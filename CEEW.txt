* Project name:		What Smart Meters Can Tell Us (Insights on Electricity Supply and Use in Mathura and Bareilly Households)
* File name:		CEEW - ReadMe.txt
* Institutions:		Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).
* Start of project: 	May, 2019
* Project purpose:	providing insights into urban household electricity consumption patterns
                        by collecting high-frequency data from nearly 100 smart meters installed
                        in Mathura and Bareilly districts of Uttar Pradesh.
* File purpose:		Read me to know about the smart meter data set and other related files that are uploaded on Harvard dataverse.
